                                                 <p>
                                                    Technology has always been something that’s both fascinated and terrified since I was a child where I learned to not trust
                                                    everything that can be clicked and downloaded on the internet. I was introduced to a video game at an early age 
                                                    called RuneScape where I could adventure online with my friends running around an open world, exploring, training my skills, 
                                                    killing dragons, and even other players. The problem was, I wasn’t very good and didn't have the time
                                                    or patience to earn gold pieces myself to become a better player. As a naive kid looking for an easy
                                                    way out, I quickly found internet tools that promised to make my character rich beyond my wildest dreams with one 
                                                    click. How lucky, I thought, I was to be one of the only people to know about this! Without question, I downloaded it and after
                                                    entering my username and password into this magical application, I sat and waited as I began to write 
                                                    down all the ways I wanted to spend my gold. Unfortunately, the gold never came as I was soon kicked offline, 
                                                    had my items stolen, and realized I was in huge trouble. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    As cheesy as it may sound, that video game led me down the path that I am so grateful to be on today. Even after 
                                                    spending several weeks grounded from infecting my family computer with viruses, I was cautiously optimistic to proceed 
                                                    into this world, but I couldn't resist. YouTube was a great source of my education, teaching me how to write my 
                                                    own programs in a text file, save it as a batch file, and force my unknowing sibling to open it and watch the shock 
                                                    on their face as hundreds of terminal windows filled the screen with, "Hello, World!" causing the computer to eventually
                                                    crash. I was on a seemingly endless journey to find out ways to break my computer, or even just find neat tricks like 
                                                    changing the WiFi password from the terminal. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    I continued with this passion into adulthood where I eventually received a job offer with a cable company that let me
                                                    professionally explore my curiosity as a career. I started at the bottom without experience, just a willingness
                                                    to learn and dedication to do what would be necessary to come out on top. This was immediately put to the test as I 
                                                    started to fall behind and struggle learning how to carry the equipment necessary to do my job, in particular 
                                                    a 32-foot extension ladder. Admittedly, I’m not the strongest nor tallest guy in the world so using brute force
                                                    wasn’t an option as other trainees were able to do. Instead, I had to master the proper 
                                                    technique, failing many times along the way, even being told by my training supervisors I should reconsider if this
                                                    is something I want to pursue. I pushed myself beyond what I thought I was capiable of, and eventually able to do this, 
                                                    and more, without problems and graduated my training class at the top, earning some of the highest scores in the class for performance. 
                                                    Eventually, after more time and dedication to perfecting my work, I was promoted to lead technician and was responsible for training new hires
                                                    for 90 days. I was the person who my team members relied on and called when they needed help or advise on one-off situations, 
                                                    and that was an amazing feeling. I soon realized, however, that the places I wanted to go with my career was not possible 
                                                    to obtain because these positions required a college degree. For me, school had never been something I was never good at, or put 
                                                    much effort into. Looking back, I saw that in the five years of my career all of the times I was told I 
                                                    couldn’t do something, and not only was I able to do it, but became one of the best at and taught others these methods. 
                                                    This told me that anything I put my mind to I can truly accomplish. I’ve attended UTC beginning Summer 2019 where I’ve consistently been 
                                                    awarded a Dean’s List participant each semester, an achievement I’ve never held in my academic life. What I study 
                                                    is my true passion, and I realize now more than ever my full potential when I put everything I have into something what I can accomplish.
                                                </p>
